# How to install and use:

1. Clone this repo
2. change into the cli directory:

- npm install
- npm install -g . (installs the "team4" command so you can use it anywhere)

3. Important!! Change to a NEW, empty directory
4. Then you can run "team4 --help" to get the available commands

Note: Make sure you do not commit generated files (.meshrc.yaml, .mesh folder, the generated package.json and package-lock.json)
