# How to install and use:

1. Clone this repo (and `cd` into the directory that is created)
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Install `nexus` command with `npm install -g .`
4. Important!! Change to a NEW, empty directory that you create *outside* of `nexus_cli` (maybe `server`?)
5. Then you can run "nexus --help" to get the available commands

Note: Make sure you do not commit generated files (.meshrc.yaml, .mesh folder, the generated package.json and package-lock.json)
